# Tattoo-Title-Popularity-Calculator
Here's the code for the beta version of the Center for Tattoo History and Culture's Tattoo Title Popularity Calculator.

You can find the calculator here (works best on desktop right now...still debugging): https://centerfortattoo.org/projects/tattoo-title-popularity-calculator/

You can read a *long* explanation of the data science behind the predictive model here: https://github.com/annafelicity/predicting_popularity/blob/master/README.md

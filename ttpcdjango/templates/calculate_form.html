    <strong>What book title might grab purchasers' attention?</strong>
Have you wondered whether a word choice between, say, "Tattoo" or "Ink" would make your book stand out more from the sea of tattooing publications that seems to increase every year?

Try out different book-title options below in the CFT's <strong>Tattoo Title Popularity Calculator</strong> to find out how many libraries your book might end up in over time:
    </div>
    <form method="post" action="." novalidate>{% csrf_token %}
    	{{ form.as_p }}
    	<input type="submit" name="submit" value="{% if calculator_result %}Redo Your Query{% else %}Enter{% endif %}" />
    </form>
    {% if calculator_result %}
    <hr>
    <div>
    Your book will be held in 
    {{ calculator_result }}
    libraries.
    </div>
    {% endif %}
